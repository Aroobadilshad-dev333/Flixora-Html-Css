# Flixora – Streaming Landing Page (HTML/CSS)

This project is a fully static landing page for a streaming-style platform called Flixora. It replicates the modern layout pattern you’d see in platforms like Netflix: a hero section, feature blocks, an FAQ accordion, and a footer.

The whole thing is built with only HTML & CSS, no JavaScript other than the radio-button accordion trick.
